# Custom Ore Generator

​	A Minecraft plugin for spigot server. This would be useful for `skyblock` servers.

​    Current functions are very simple, and I would keep update this plugin.

​    The test minecraft server version is 1.15.2, but I think lower versions are also able to use.

## Usage

1. Put this plugin into your server plugins/ folder.
2. Restart the server or use plugman to load this plugin.
3. Enjoy it.
